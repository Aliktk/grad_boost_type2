# Adding code and code block

We always print the first line of code by doing this print`("Hello world")` So we can specify the coding style like this

we can do multi line code like

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as plt
import seaborn as sas
```
<!-- we can also show that coopy button on the right side corner to copy the code -->

> To show other programming language so we will specify that name of the language with that line three first apostrophy

> like this;

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as plt
import seaborn as sas
```
<!-- it can be capital or small -->
> for R (You can also specify your language)

```r
import numpy as np
a = 5
b = 5
```
